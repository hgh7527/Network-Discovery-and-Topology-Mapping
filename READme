• Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): No MFA was in place, making it easier
for attackers to compromise credentials.
• Unpatched Systems: Several systems were not up to date with the latest security
patches, leaving them open to exploitation.
Recommended Fixes:
1. Immediate Actions:
o Change all passwords across the network, with emphasis on strong password
policies.
o Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all critical systems.
o Patch and update all systems, prioritizing those with known vulnerabilities.
2. Long-term Fixes:
o Establish an IR Team and Structure, to include a CISO Position.
o Create an IR Plan
o List your Long-Term Fixes beyond the previous 2.
Creating an Incident Response (IR) Team: To ensure SAM LLC can respond effectively to
future incidents, it is essential to establish a dedicated Incident Response Team. The following
structure and budget are recommended:
• Team Structure: (NOTE: Include Team Member Role)
o List your team structure, Example:
o Incident Response Manager: Oversees the team’s actions and liaises with
executive leadership.
• Office Location: Explain (secure? isolated? Restricted access?)
• Budget Recommendations:
o Personnel: Salaries for the team members. (remember this is a summary report,
this statement alone works just fine, the IR Plan provides more explanation)
o Tools and Software: Funding for security tools, such as IDS systems, forensic
software, and hardware for analysis.
o Training and Certification: Budget for ongoing training to keep the team up to
date on the latest cybersecurity threats.
Conclusion: The phishing attack on SAM LLC exposed several weaknesses in the company’s
security posture. By following the recommended fixes and establishing a well-trained and
adequately funded Incident Response Team, SAM LLC can better safeguard its network and
data. The CEO has approved the request to establish the IR Team and its necessary resources.
Part 2:
Task Overview:
Building the Incident Response Team and IR Playbook
o After the CEO has approved the creation of the IR Team based on your Executive
Summary Report, you will:
▪ Create an Incident Response Plan that encompasses the items below.
▪ Create an Incident Response Team:
1. Design the structure of the team, including key roles (e.g., Incident
Response Manager, Security Analysts, Forensics Experts,
Communications Officer).
2. Create a budget for the IR Team, covering personnel costs, tools,
software, and training.
3. Recommend an office location and furnishings for the team,
ensuring it is secure and adequately equipped for responding to
incidents. (Budget for Facility Build, What do you Need?)
▪ Develop an Incident Response Playbook for how the IR Team will
operate when an attack (event/incident) occurs. This playbook should
have multiple parts and provided processes and procedures for the listed
types of cyber-attacks.
PART 2 CONTINUED:
Incident Response Plan Deliverables:
1. IR Team Creation:
o Define roles and responsibilities for each team member involved in incident
response (e.g., Incident Response Manager, Forensics Analyst, Security Analysts,
Communications Officer, Hire Hancock?? Pros and Cons….).
2. IR Team Budget:
o Create a budget for the IR Team that covers:
▪ Salaries for team members.
▪ Setup costs for hardware and software.
▪ Tools and resources necessary for response (e.g., IDS systems, forensic
tools, cell phones, etc).
▪ Office space and accommodations for the IR Team to work securely.
3. IR Playbook:
o A tactical guide for responding to specific cyber incidents. This should include:
▪ Communication Tree: Define how information flows within the
organization during a cyber event/incident (does it change? does it matter?
who needs to know what and when).
▪ Severity Model: Develop a model for categorizing the severity of events
and incidents (e.g., low, medium, high) and determine the response actions
for each level.
▪ Phishing Incidents: Steps for identifying, containing, and recovering
from phishing attacks.
▪ Malware Discovery:
▪ Dynamic Analysis: Analyzing malware in a controlled
environment to understand its behavior.
▪ Static Analysis: Examining the malware without executing it to
look for indicators of compromise (IOCs).
▪ DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service): Procedures for mitigating DDoS
attacks and protecting critical systems.
▪ Physical Protection:
▪ Physical Controls: Measures to protect physical assets (e.g.,
locking server rooms, using access cards).
▪ Deterrent Controls: Measures to discourage physical breaches
(e.g., cameras, alarms).
▪ Preventive Controls: Implemented to physically prevent
unauthorized access or security incidents from occurring. (locked
doors, biometric readers, secure destruction of documents)
▪ Incident Containment and Mitigation: Actions taken to stop the incident
from spreading and to mitigate damage (e.g., isolating infected systems,
blocking malicious IP addresses).
Part 3: Panopto Video Presentation
Task 3: Create the Video Presentation of Findings to discuss the information from Part
1 and Part 2.
o You need to present your overall findings from Part 1 and Part 2 to the Executive
Leadership Team, and answer the following questions:
1. Justification for the IR Team and Budget
5. Why does SAM LLC need a dedicated IR Team at this time?
6. What are the biggest cyber threats facing our company today?
7. Have we experienced prior security incidents? What were the costs and consequences?
8. What are the risks of not having an IR Team in place?
9. What is the estimated return on investment (ROI) for this initiative?
10. How does this budget compare to industry standards for companies of our size?
2. IR Team Structure and Responsibilities
• What roles will be included in the IR Team, and what will each person do?
• Will this team be in-house, outsourced, or a hybrid model?
• How will the IR Team coordinate with existing IT and security personnel?
• What expertise do we need to hire or train for the team to be effective?
• How will this team function during normal business operations versus an active incident?
3. IR Budget Justification
• How much funding is required for:
o Salaries and personnel?
o Security tools and technologies?
o Training and certifications?
o Office space and physical security improvements?
• Are there cost-effective alternatives (e.g., outsourcing certain functions)?
• How will the budget be spent over the next 1–3 years?
• Are there potential cost savings from cyber insurance or regulatory incentives?
4. IR Plan and Playbook Details
• What types of cyber incidents are covered in the IR Plan?
• How does the IR Playbook define response steps for common threats (phishing, malware,
ransomware, DDoS, insider threats, etc.)?
• What is our incident severity model, and how does it dictate response actions?
• How does the IR Plan integrate with business continuity and disaster recovery?
• What compliance or legal requirements does this IR Plan help us meet?
• How do we ensure continuous improvement in our response processes?
5. Implementation and Effectiveness
• How soon can this IR Team be operational?
• How will we measure the effectiveness of the IR Team?
• How often will we conduct incident response drills or tabletop exercises?
• How does this plan align with our overall cybersecurity strategy and risk management
goals?
• What metrics and KPIs will the IR Team report to the executive leadership?
Final CEO Consideration: Answer these Final Questions
What is the risk of doing nothing?
What is the best-case and worst-case scenario if we move forward with this plan?
AND FINALLY:
➢ Why should I hire you as SAM LLCs newly appointed Chief Information Security
Officer (CISO), and why should I implement your recommendations regarding your IR
TEAM personnel. Why can’t I just hire my son and his buddies?
By asking these questions, the CEO ensures that the IR initiative is well-planned, cost-effective,
and aligned with business goals.
This structure focuses on creating a comprehensive IR Plan, which includes detailed actions for
specific types of incidents (IR Playbook), while considering both technical and procedural
controls. This structure is the overall framework, and from here, you can start filling in the
details.
Deliverables:
o A detailed Initial Executive Summary / Incident Response Report (2–3 pages).
o An IR Plan that includes a proposal for the structure, budget, office
accommodations, and playbook for the IR Team.
o Panopto Interview discussing your plan and team with the Executive Leadership
of SAM LLC.
Outcome: By the end of this assignment, you will have a solid understanding of the technical
aspects of network vulnerability analysis, along with the strategic planning necessary to create an
effective Incident Response Plan, Team, and Playbook. You will also gain practical experience
in organizing a team and budgeting for incident response within a corporate environment.
Tips for Success:
• Think critically about the role each team member will play in incident response and
ensure that you justify the roles and responsibilities in your report.
• When developing the IR Plan/Playbook, consider the types of attacks SAM LLC could
face in the future and how your team can be prepared.
• The CEO wants the IR Team to be effective, so ensure the budget is realistic and
accounts for the tools and training needed.
Good luck, and feel free to ask any questions if you're unsure about any part of the assignment
